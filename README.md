Live timeseries analysis on your desktop!

# About

Lognplot is a graphical viewer for time series data. Unlike many other
projects in this area, lognplot is not a hosted web application.
It is a desktop application which visualizes your data from your
application. This can be an embedded, robotic, mobile, PC or PLC application.

Features:
- Plot data live while staying responsive
- Send data over TCP/IP link to GUI.
- Two GUI implementations:
    - python GUI implementation (based on PyQt5)
    - rust GUI implementation (based on gtk-rs / cairo)
- Client libraries for:
    - Python
    - C
    - Rust
- Export data to HDF5
- Data adapters for:
    - ADS
    - MQTT
    - ROS2

# Video

These are recorded videos of the tool:

- [lognplot @ FOSDEM 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ema_lognplot/)

# Screenshots

This is an example screenshot of the lognplot python application, visualizing
10 million datapoints. Note that zooming is still smoothly performed.

![screenshot3](screenshots/screenshot3.png)

This is an example screenshot of the GTK gui implemented with rust, visualizing also 10 million
datapoints.

![screenshot4](screenshots/screenshot4.png)

This is an example of the plot window, when zoomed out.
Note that not all points are displayed, but aggregates
of the data are visualized as min/max/mean/stddev lines.

When zooming into the data, the individual data points come
into picture.

# Installation

Note that at this moment, you will want to grab the latest
git version from github.

First clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/windelbouwman/lognplot.git

For python, follow this steps:

    $ cd lognplot/python
    $ pip install .
    $ python -m lognplot

For rust, follow these steps:

    $ cd lognplotgtk
    $ cargo run --release

Packages are released for rust and python

Rust crate: https://crates.io/crates/lognplot

Python package: https://pypi.org/project/lognplot/

## Requirements

For the GTK variant of the tool, you need the following to be installed:

- cairo-gobject-devel
- pango-devel
- atk-devel
- gdk-pixbuf2-devel
- gtk3-devel
- hdf5-devel

# Usage

To use the python side of this code, start as a demo the softscope:

    $ cd python
    $ python softscope.py

This will popup a plot window. Zooming and panning can be done with the keyboard
keys w,a,s,d and i,j,k,l. Press space or enter to autofit. The data is
a 10 kHz generated signal.

Another demo is the softscope server. This will open a TCP/IP port
which can receive data.

    $ cd python
    $ python -m lognplot

The softscope is now
ready to receive streaming data via network.

Next, start the demo datasource, which will send data via TCP to this GUI:

    $ cd demo
    $ python noize_source.py

Another server demo is the rust side of the code. Start the GUI like this:

    $ cd lognplotgtk
    $ cargo run

This application will be able to receive data via TCP/IP.

# Send data from C code

To send data from C-code, refer to the demo in `demo/c`. This demo uses
the clognplot rust crate, which is a static library which can be used from C.
The resulting C program will connect over TCP/IP and send its data to the plot
tool using parts of the rust crates.

# Export data to HDF5

To be able to further process the data in, for example, a python script, you
can use File->Save to save all captured data as a HDF5 file.

Example usage of this saved HDF5 file:

```python

import h5py
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

f = h5py.File('datorz.h5', 'r')
group = f['my_datorz']
signal = group['My_signal']
plt.plot(signal[:,0], signal[:,1])
plt.show()

```

# Plan

This is a list of things to do:

- PyQt5 implementation
- gtk-rs implementation

# Requirements for live data visualization

- Append data structure to enable appending new data
- Data point aggregation for zooming out and showing min/max/mean lines
